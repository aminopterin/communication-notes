# Digital Communication (I): Notes
*spring 2017*

These are notes I wrote, paraphrased from the lecture notes for the course Digital Communication (I) professor Char-Dir Chung (鐘嘉德) taught during spring 2017.

Type `fake_make.sh` to compile, which calls `pdflatex`. You can not simply do this though, since it invokes scripts and includes templates I saved elsewhere. Please see repo `templates_configs_scripts` for more information.
